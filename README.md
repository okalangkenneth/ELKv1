# Logging in an ASP.NET Application using Docker, Elasticsearch, and Kibana.

## Introduction:


Logging is an essential part of any application, as it provides valuable insights into its performance and usage. In this readme, we'll walk through the process of setting up a logging solution for an ASP.NET application using Docker, Elasticsearch, and Kibana. This stack provides a scalable, centralized, and cost-effective way to store, analyze, and visualize logs generated by your application.


For example, a company running an e-commerce website could use this logging stack to monitor their website's performance and track any errors that may occur. The ASP.NET application running on a Docker container generates logs that are sent to Elasticsearch using the Serilog library. Elasticsearch indexes the logs, and Kibana provides a web interface for searching, filtering, and visualizing the logs. This allows the company to quickly identify issues, track performance over time, and scale the logging solution as their business grows.


By following the steps outlined in this readme, you'll be able to implement a complete logging stack that provides scalability, searchability, visualization, and centralization of your application's logs.
