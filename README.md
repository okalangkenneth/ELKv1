# Logging in an ASP.NET Application using Docker, Elasticsearch, and Kibana.

## Introduction:


Logging is an essential part of any application, as it provides valuable insights into its performance and usage. In this demonstration, we'll walk through the process of setting up a logging solution for an ASP.NET application using Docker, Elasticsearch, and Kibana. This stack provides a scalable, centralized, and cost-effective way to store, analyze, and visualize logs generated by your application.

For example, a company running an e-commerce website could use this logging stack to monitor their website's performance and track any errors that may occur. The ASP.NET application running on a Docker container generates logs that are sent to Elasticsearch using the Serilog library. Elasticsearch indexes the logs, and Kibana provides a web interface for searching, filtering, and visualizing the logs. This allows the company to quickly identify issues, track performance over time, and scale the logging solution as their business grows.

In this demonstration, we'll cover the following steps:

- Setting up Docker and running Elasticsearch and Kibana containers
- Creating an ASP.NET 6 web API project with Serilog logging
- Configuring Serilog to send logs to Elasticsearch
- Running the web API project in a Docker container and generating logs
- Using Kibana to search, filter, and visualize the logs
Throughout the demonstration, we'll include snapshots of the code and Docker containers running, so you can see exactly how everything works together to create a robust logging solution.
